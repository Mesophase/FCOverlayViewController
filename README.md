## FCOverlay

FCOverlay allows you to present a new view controller hierarchy in a new window. 

When you present a view controller via one of the provided methods it is presented in
a new window on top of all existing windows (including those generated by FCOverlay). The
new window is transparent so you can use this to create HUD's, alerts etc... (run the 
example project for some examples).

The nice thing about FCOverlay is that you don't have to keep track of the current visible
view controller and present a new view controller on that view controller. You can just
present and dismiss any kind of view controller on top of all others from everywhere in 
your code.

FCOverlay allows you to present this to the user as if it is just a "normal" controller
transition.
